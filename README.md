# AkshitTextExample
A C++ project I did in ~`20`+ hours to show a *beginner* friend how he could go about rewriting his program.

Nicely organized! *...procedural code*, ..yeah. Using pure functions wherever possible, though.

*(If this program had fuzzy matching to go along with the string token comparison algorithm already in it, it would've been awesome!)*
